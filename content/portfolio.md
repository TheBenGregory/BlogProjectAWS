### gigAgent

##### Overview

gigAgent was my first ground-up client side build. I utilized React.js and CSS for the styling to create a peer-to-peer platform for real estate agents. The intent is to connect busy agents with available agents to perform showings, freeing up time and travel for the busy agent, and providing an income opportunity for the available agent.

It utilizes a JSON server built and served locally to store user data. The users can be one of two types (gigAgent or a requesting agent) and requests can be generated via form by the requesting agent and accepted and completed by the gigAgent.

##### Learning Experience

gigAgent is the project where React really came into focus for me. Hooks took hold in my mind and I was able to really affect the data being moved around the application. I utilized hooks, event targeting, a variety of fetch calls, and made it all dance in JSX. 

At the end of the two week sprint there were some lessons learned:
* an apiManager module would have allowed for much cleaner, more readable code
* I planned a lot, but I did not plan enough. Plan, plan, plan.
* There is a difference between enjoying application design/styling and being good at application design/styling. I could not have been more sick of the color scheme I had landed on in the beginning. :)
